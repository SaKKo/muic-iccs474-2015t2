### GIT

Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on specific project independently.

Write your own note, it is very important that your remember these commands

Commands reference from Live example.
```bash
git init
git status
git add .
git commit -am '<MESSAGE>'
git branch <BRANCHNAME>
git checkout <BRANCHNAME>
git merge <BRANCHNAME>
git remote -v
git remote add origin <GIT URL>
git remote remove origin <GIT URL>
git push
git pull
git clone <GIT URL> <TARGET PATH>

### Ruby

We've learned a few ruby syntax today. We will be using it quite a lot. You might want to read more about its basic syntax.

This is one great online tutorial.

Just like python, you can start ruby shell by running `irb` in terminal. Then you can start writing ruby code there.

## Think!

1. Why do we need to learn bash? Is it really necessary?
1. Is there any other version control other than git?
1. Command Line is boring, are there tools that can be used with git?
1. How do we ignore files so that it won't be committed into git.
1. Why don't we want to commit everything into git?
1. Which kind of project or file type to avoid using git?
1. Can we version control something else that's not even a code?
    1. Example, a MS docx file.
    1. Is it good to version control MS docx?
